                <p>Intramurals are times when students are legally permitted to participate in sports such as volleyball, basketball, and badminton. Typically, this is done in the month of November. This is similar to a competition in which the goal is to win. However, the goal of intramurals is not only to win, but also to have fun. Even if non-winners do not receive a medal or trophy, what matters is that they gave it their all, and that is what Intramurals are all about.</p>

            <p><i>Our Lady of Light Parish</i> is the name of this parish. It is a parish designed for people to attend mass, particularly Catholics. Anyone is welcome to attend mass here. There are no fees to pay. If you want to attend a mass, you should go to this parish. If the outside is fascinating, so is the inside.

            <p><i>CCC's Library</i> is open to all students. We can read books, magazines, short stories, and other materials there. The Library, like any other library, contains a large number of books. Because of the quietness and cold air in the room, every student can concentrate in this library. The library, on the other hand, is extremely secure. To go on this, you must have a library card. If you lose it, you must either try to replicate it or write a letter stating that you have lost it in order to gain access.</p>

However, there are foods in the cafeteria that are both healthy and delicious. They serve well-prepared dishes that are pleasant for students to eat. On the other hand, the cafeteria is occasionally filthy, requiring us to eat elsewhere. Nevertheless, the food in here is generally good.</p>

They serve as the primary location for the school's facilities and campuses. The cafeteria, library, computer lab, gymnasium, and other amenities can be found here. The structure is very tall and sturdy. It's been a great place to walk and have fun ever since.</p>

Computer labs are located in the Centennial Building and other buildings. They are also used to administer exams and evaluate teachers. Because of the cold air in the room, it has been a great place to cool down since then.</p>
