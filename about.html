            <p>Cainta Catholic College is well-known for the well-constructed "Our Lady of Light Parish." According to a blog, it is one of the most beautiful churches ever built in the Philippines. It is very elegant, as you can see from the outside. And so is the interior. When you enter the church, you will notice a large space that leads to the altar of God. The decors and cross-shaped structure make it very pleasing and appealing to the eyes. As a result, seeing this church is a huge deal. So come on in and attend a mass here every now and then!</p>

            <p>Alma Mater dear all hail to thee<br>
            We will sing your praise and glory<br>
            You have led and made us fight for right<br>
